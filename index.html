        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently in my first year of college. I graduated high school in June of 2021, I graduated with a grade point average of  3.4, I always excelled in math and science. Since the beginning of my high school career I was in a program called college track where they help students get to their goals of applying and attending a 4-year University. College track also helped students financially and helped them find what they wanted to achieve once they were out of high school. One of the many things that college track allowed me to experience was their interaction with many professions, one of them being the profession that I want to achieve now.  With college track I was also able to volunteer in many places such as church, homeless shelters, and in animal centers. One of the many experiences that serves my profession now is the volunteer work that I did in the church.
	While volunteering in the church I was a teacher aide and worked with kids. I would work with many teachers who had students between the ages of 6-8 and 11-13. In those groups, the teachers assigned me groups of 3-4, depending on how many students attended class that day. One of the subjects that I would teach and support students in was English and Writing Skills. Another one of my volunteering jobs was in a tutoring program, I would tutor students in 4th grade. One of the main experience skills I gained was structuring lesson plans and setting rules that do not limit kids as much. Once the structuring part of tutoring was done with I was able to gain public speaking experience because I would speak in front of multiple children which allowed me to shake the nerves off of the things that I would do to this day speaking in front of adults is still nerve-wracking speaking to children is not as  complicated as it was before.  as of now I am in a 4-year University and I am working towards achieving my teaching credentials to later possibly become an elementary teacher.
